* ARIMA Modelling Procedure    
  (1) Plot the data and identify any unusual observations.  
  (2) If necessary, transform the data (using a [Box-Cox Transformation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YenLinWu/Time_Series_Model/blob/main/Materials/Box_Cox_Transformation.ipynb)) to stabilise the variance.  
  (3) If the data are non-stationary, take first differences of the data until the data are stationary.  
  (4) Examine the ACF/PACF: Is an ARIMA( p, d, 0 ) or ARIMA( 0, d, q ) model appropriate?  
  (5) Try your chosen model(s), and use the AICc to search for a better model.  
  (6) Check the residuals from your chosen model by plotting the ACF of the residuals, and doing a portmanteau test of the residuals. If they do not look like white noise, try a modified model.   
  (7) Once the residuals look like white noise, calculate forecasts.
